			<h3>@LSystemBot - <a href="https://twitter.com/LSystemBot">Link</a></h3>
			<p>LSystemBot procedurally generates short rules for Lindenmeyer systems, renders them, and posts to twitter every hour on the hour. Rendering is currently being done with Paper.js. The idea for this bot was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Algorithmic_Beauty_of_Plants">this book</a>.</p>
